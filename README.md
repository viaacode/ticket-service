# ticket-service

Ticket-service generates authentication tokens.
Constructs JWT authentication tokens.
A typical use case is as request parameter or authentication header to assure that
the request has been generated by a trusted app within a valid user session
for a given url, referrer and client ip.

The token contains:
* an application id (aud)
* an expiration date (exp)
* a name, typically the id or url of the object (sub)
* the ip address of the client (ip)
* the HTTP referer (referer)
* the range within the object to which access is granted (fragment)

The token is formatted as a [JSON Web token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/).

```json
{
    "aud": "<application id>",
    "exp": "<expiration time>",
    "sub": "<name>",
    "ip": "<clientip>",
    "referer": "<HTTP referer>",
    "fragment" : {
         "start": "<fragment start>",
         "end": "<fragment end>"
    }
}
```

## Examples

#### Request

```bash
curl -X GET --key mycert.key --cert mycert.cert -d '{
  "app": "app1",
  "referer": https://example.org/media/",
  "client": "91.183.203.23"
  }' http://api.example.org/ticket/media/browse.mp4
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjAwMDIifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJhcHAxIiwiZXhwIjoxNTYyNTgwOTI4LCJzdWIiOiJtZWRpYS9icm93c2UubXA0IiwiaXAiOiI5MS4xODMuMjAzLjIzIiwicmVmZXJlciI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5vcmcvbWVkaWEvIiwiZnJhZ21lbnQiOnsic3RhcnQiOiIwMDowNDoyNy4wMDAiLCJlbmQiOiIwMDowNTowNi4wMDAifX0......",
  "context": {
    "aud": "app1",
    "exp": 1562580928,
    "sub": "media/browse.mp4",
    "ip": "91.183.203.23",
    "referer": "https://example.org/media/",
    "fragment": {
      "start": "00:04:27.000",
      "end": "00:05:06.000"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

The ticket attributes can be given in a JSON formatted request body, as request uri
parameters or a combination of both.
If the `app` or the `name` attributes are missing from the request, they are
deduced from the certificate's first `O` attribute and the request uri respectively.

`referer` is optional.

Access to the service requires a signed client certificate with a DC attribute `ticket`. The `O` attributes
of the subject restrict the mediafiles for which a ticket will be generated.
For example, the following certificate subject will allow to generate tokens for content owned by *org1*.
```
DC=ticket,O=org1,CN=John (jwt),emailAddress=john.thearchivist@example.org
```
Requests for content not owned by *org1* will invoke a HTTP 403 response.

(The code assumes that the client certificate is verified upstream, injecting the
certificate subject in a header.)
